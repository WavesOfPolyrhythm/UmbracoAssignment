Technical overview:

SUMMARY
This assignment has helped me build a strong and practical understanding of how to structure and develop a CMS-driven website using Umbraco.
While I chose to exclude email verification, I focused deeply on reusable components, responsive design, clear structure, and a good user and editor experience.
